# Definition of the networks to attach to all the nodes.
# The "internet" parameter, if set to true, will make sure there's an iptables rule providing masquerading to the interface that has access to Internet.
# The "promisc" parameter, if set to true, adds the promiscous mode to the bridge.
# You can change the subnet_name parameter to have better names of bridges on the host, however be careful - it has a length limit of about 15 chars, and prefixes are added!
# Note that the MAC addresses contain just five sections, the last one is going to be incremental like 00, 01, 02 etc.
